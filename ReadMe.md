## Overview

The ElasticSearchSolution project provides a practical implementation of 
how to interact with Elasticsearch using the Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch package. 
This project demonstrates key operations like indexing, retrieving, and searching documents 
within Elasticsearch, and includes a health check to ensure the Elasticsearch service is 
running and accessible. 
It's an excellent starting point for developers looking to integrate Elasticsearch into their applications 
for efficient and scalable search functionality.

Components Details
Controller/SimpleElasticTestController.cs:

This controller exposes RESTful API endpoints to interact with Elasticsearch.
It includes methods for:
Indexing documents into Elasticsearch.
Retrieving documents based on various search criteria.
Searching documents using Elasticsearch's querying capabilities.
HealthTest/ElasticHealthCheck.cs:

Provides a health check mechanism to verify the availability and health of the Elasticsearch service.
Ensures that the application can connect to Elasticsearch and perform basic operations.
Utils/Interfaces/IElasticSearchClient.cs:

An interface that defines the core methods for interacting with Elasticsearch.
Methods include indexing, searching, and retrieving documents.
Encourages the use of dependency injection, making the code more modular and testable.
Utils/ElasticSearchClient.cs:

The concrete implementation of the IElasticSearchClient interface.
Uses the Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch package to perform operations like:
Indexing documents into an Elasticsearch index.
Searching for documents using various criteria.
This class is where the actual interaction with the Elasticsearch API happens.
Program.cs:

Acts as the entry point for the application.
Configures services such as the Elasticsearch client and registers the health check.
Sets up routing and middleware components for the API.
ElasticSearchSolution.csproj:

Defines the project configuration, including dependencies, target frameworks, and build options.
Lists all the packages required for the project, such as Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch for Elasticsearch integration.
